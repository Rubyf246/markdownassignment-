He used to call me DN <br>
That stood for Deadly Nightshade <br>
'Cause I was filled with poison <br>
But blessed with beauty and rage <br>
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss <br>
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids <br>

### _[Chorus]_
With his ultraviolence <br>
***Ultraviolence*** <br>
***Ultraviolence*** <br>
***Ultraviolence*** <br>
I can hear sirens, sirens <br>
He hit me and it felt like a kiss <br>
I can hear violins, violins <br>
Give me all of that ultraviolence <br>

### _[Verse 2]_
He used to call me poison <br>
Like I was poison ivy <br>
I could have died right there <br>
'Cause he was right beside me <br>
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love <br>
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough <br>
